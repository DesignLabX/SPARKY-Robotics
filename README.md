# SPARKY-Robotics

SPARKY 
(Saint Paul Academic Robotics Kit)

Sparky is an open robotics platform and corresponding curriculum framework informed by and designed for robotics education. 


The Robot: 

The robot design is modular, reconfigurable and extendable allowing the curriculum to drive the configuration of the robot and for the robot to evolve along with the curriculum.

All robot parts are designed to be makerspace-manufacturable at any makerspace equiped with a 3D-printer and a laser cutter.  3MF and STL files are freely available online.

The robot is designed to be user-assembled with simple tools, including only a 2.5mm hex-driver and 5.5mm nut drive for assembly of mechanicals. 

The electronic components used are commodity parts which are inexpensive and widely available. 

A breadboard is used to receive a variety of microcontrollers. The current design is based on the exellect Adafruit Feather microcontroller platform. 

Electronics connections are made with commonly available jumper wires. 

Minimal soldering may be necessary depending on electronics parts availability. Currently, an electronics design is illustrated using the .


The Curriculum:

Each student builds, wires and programs their own robot as they learn the basic concepts of robotics. Assessments consist of a checkpoint and a challenge for each concept/sensor/actuator. The checkpoint checks for student understanding and robot functionality. The challenge asks students to apply the new concept, along with other covered material, to a new challenge.
